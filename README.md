# follow-manager
A tool to see who you follow and on what platforms you follow them

Created this tool to make it easier to manage RSS feeds, but it can also be used to just have an overview of the accounts you follow

Backend is created with flask, SQLite
Fronted is created with Bootstrap

## To add:

### Donation manager

So that you can see who you donate to
You will be able to see a total of money donated each month/week etc

### RSS URL generator

Meaning that given a username and a link template like: https://www.example.com/{username}/rss

Also an RSS mirror manager, lets say you use an RSS-bridge of some sort, and to not overuse a single mirror you create a list of mirrors that you want to use, and then the RSS mirror manager creates links with an equal amount of links per mirror.

### tags/categories

You can tag or set categories on the users you follow, like "tech", "gaming" etc

### export and import

export and import in an XML or json format or something else
